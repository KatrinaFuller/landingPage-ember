    <p>My name is Katrina Fuller. I am excited about starting my career as a Software Developer! I started teaching
      myself how
      to code after work and on the weekends through online sites like freeCodeCamp, Lynda, and Pluralsight. After 8
      months of
      studying, I found that I love coding and all of the challenges that come with it. I decided I wanted to pursue
      a career
      as a Software Developer. I looked at several options and found BoiseCodeWorks to be the right opportunity for
      me. After
      an intensive 13 weeks, and completion of BoiseCodeWorks immersive full-stack program, I am confident that I
      have refined
      the skills needed to start working as a Software Developer.</p>
